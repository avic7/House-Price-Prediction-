# House-Price-Prediction-
In this project, we will be using Ames Housing Dataset to predict House Sale Price on the test dataset 
and minimise the RMSE. I have used Linear Regression Model to predict the sale prices. To improve our 
prediction, we will perform data pre-processing and manipulation steps like handling outliers, filling missing 
data, ordinal and one hot encoding etc to figure out how we can train the best performing Linear Regression 
Model. I will also take you through why I decided to do some pre-processing and cleaning steps.
